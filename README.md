# Dynamic-Golden-Crossover
 My take on the quantitative investing model Goden Crossover

 How to: simply change the ticker and start date as desired.

 Abstract:
The Golden Cross-over strategy is a popular technical analysis trading strategy that involves the
crossing over of two moving averages, typically the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving
average. In this paper, we provide an overview of the history and creation of the Golden Cross-over
strategy, as well as its use and overall performance. We also expand on the different windows of time
used in this strategy and explain why the 200-50 window is the most popular.

Furthermore, we investigate how to use a stock's historical volatility to create dynamic trading
windows for the Golden Cross-over strategy. By analyzing historical data and determining the optimal
moving averages that capture the stock's volatility and trends, we define the rules for entry and exit.
Our research shows that using dynamic windows based on historical volatility can improve the
performance of the Golden Cross-over strategy by providing faster or slower signals depending on the
stock's characteristics
.
Overall, our findings suggest that adapting the Golden Cross-over strategy using historical volatility
for dynamic trading windows can lead to improved trading results by optimizing the strategy based on
changing market conditions and the stock's volatility
